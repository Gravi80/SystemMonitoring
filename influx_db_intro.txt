InfluxDB can use different storage engines for the underlying storage of data. The current options are LevelDB, RocksDB, HyperLevelDB, and LMDB.

InfluxDB data structure

* Measurements
* Series
* Points

Points
-------
Points are like rows which consist of :
1). time (a timestamp), 
2). A measurement ("temperature", for example), 
3). At least one key-value field (the measured value itself, e.g. "external=20", or "internal=30"), and
4). Zero to many key-value tags containing any metadata about the value (e.g. "host=serverA", "dc=India").

$influx
>CREATE DATABASE demo
>USE demo
>INSERT temparature,host=serverA,dc=India external=25,internal=37

A point with the measurement 
name=temperature, 
tags=host and dc 
measured value= 25 and 37


Series
------- 
Have zero to many points, one for each discrete sample of the metric.

>INSERT temparature,host=serverA,dc=India external=25,internal=37
>INSERT temparature,host=serverB,dc=UK external=15,internal=10
>INSERT memory,host=serverA,dc=India value=100
>INSERT memory,host=serverB,dc=UK value=150
>SHOW SERIES

memory,dc=India,host=serverA
memory,dc=UK,host=serverB
temparature,dc=India,host=serverA
temparature,dc=UK,host=serverB


Measurements
-------------
Series are grouped together by a string identifier to form a measurement.
You can have millions of measurement, don't have to define schema upfront.

>SHOW MEASUREMENTS
name: measurements

temparature


Query
------
Conceptually you can think of a measurement as an SQL table, where the primary index is always time. 
The timestamp is the Unix time in nanoseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC. (Epoch time)

Tags and fields are effectively columns in the table. tags are indexed, and fields are not. 

> SELECT internal,external from temparature where host='serverA' and time > now() - 1h
name: temparature
time                internal external
